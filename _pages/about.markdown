Hello and welcome to my website. I am a senior Mechanical and Aeropsace engineer, currently working in the defence industry. My interests lie 
in the field of mechanical engineering (more precisely FEA and CFD) and in the field of data science - reinforced learning. While I am currently a 
beginner in the machine learning, I don't plan to stay that way for very long. Therefore with that in mind, I have developed this website. This website will serve two purposes:
1. To keep myself honest. Honest that I will always continue to learn and develop in both the area of engineering and machine learning
2. To showcase what I have achieved and hope to inspire others

New projects will be posted on a semi-regular basis ( bi-weekly), therfore make sure to check back.
